# project-fa25-View2Lidar
We present View2Lidar, a latent diffusion framework for LiDAR reconstruction and cross-modal generation. An encoderâ€“decoder autoencoder learns LiDAR latents, while a transformer-based decoder denoises them. Vision features from DINOv2 and YOLO are mapped to this latent space, enabling dense LiDAR reconstruction from images.
